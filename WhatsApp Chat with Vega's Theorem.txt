29/07/25, 3:18 pm - .: Seite 1: Willkommen in der Welt der Gummi-Formen

Stell dir vor, du hast einen Donut. Das ist ein runder Kuchen mit einem Loch in der Mitte. Und jetzt stell dir eine Tasse Kaffee vor. Eine normale Tasse hat einen Henkel. Dieser Henkel ist wie ein Loch. Kannst du glauben, dass ein Donut und eine Kaffeetasse in der Mathematik gleich sind? Das klingt verrückt, oder? Aber es ist wahr! Das ist die Welt der Topologie.

Topologie ist ein besonderer Teil der Mathematik. Man nennt sie manchmal auch die "Gummi-Geometrie". Warum Gummi? Weil du in der Topologie Formen dehnen, biegen und ziehen darfst. Du kannst sie machen, wie du willst, als wären sie aus weichem Gummi. Aber es gibt eine sehr wichtige Regel: Du darfst die Form nicht kaputt machen! Du darfst sie nicht schneiden. Und du darfst keine neuen Löcher machen oder alte Löcher schließen. Wenn du diese Regeln beachtest, dann sind ein Donut und eine Kaffeetasse das Gleiche. Beide haben genau ein Loch.

Ein Ball hat kein Loch. Eine normale, flache Pizza hat auch kein Loch. Deshalb sind ein Ball und eine Pizza in der Topologie gleich. Sie haben beide keine Löcher. Es ist eine sehr lustige Idee, oder? Die Topologie fragt: Was ist wirklich wichtig an einer Form? Was bleibt, wenn wir sie ganz stark verändern, aber nicht zerstören? Das ist eine sehr grundlegende Frage. Diese einfache Idee hat aber eine lange und interessante Geschichte. Sie begann vor vielen, vielen Jahren. Wir werden jetzt zusammen auf diese Reise gehen und sehen, wie sich diese spannende Mathematik entwickelt hat.

30/07/25, 2:17 pm - Vega's Theorem: That has to be associative and respect identity
30/07/25, 2:17 pm - Vega's Theorem: We do not have internal structure for the objects of a Category
30/07/25, 2:18 pm - .: Wdym by we do not have structure?
30/07/25, 2:18 pm - Vega's Theorem: So we use Universal Properties to do interesting math
30/07/25, 2:18 pm - Vega's Theorem: Objects are "flat"
30/07/25, 2:18 pm - .: Oh okay
30/07/25, 2:18 pm - Vega's Theorem: In the category of sets objects have subjects
30/07/25, 2:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: But that needn't be the case in general
30/07/25, 2:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: One common example of universal Property is the product
30/07/25, 2:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: Oh, well
30/07/25, 2:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: I need to explain final and initial objects first
30/07/25, 2:20 pm - Vega's Theorem: A initial object is basically one where it has **exactly** one arrow (morphism) going to every other object in the category
30/07/25, 2:20 pm - Vega's Theorem: And the final object follows the same logic
30/07/25, 2:20 pm - Vega's Theorem: It so happens that initial and final objects are **unique up to isomorphism**
30/07/25, 2:21 pm - Vega's Theorem: Which means that they are different but all isomorphism
30/07/25, 2:21 pm - Vega's Theorem: No one is better than the other
30/07/25, 2:22 pm - .: What's an isomorphism (I know what morphism is)
30/07/25, 2:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Well
30/07/25, 2:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Actually a morphism in category theory is nothing like a function
30/07/25, 2:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: It is a very abstract concept
30/07/25, 2:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Is anything that can be composed and it's associative
30/07/25, 2:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: In the category of the integers and the order ≤, ≤ is a morphism
30/07/25, 2:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: "maps" 1 to 2, for example
30/07/25, 2:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: 1 ≤ 2
30/07/25, 2:24 pm - .: I'm aware
30/07/25, 2:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: An isomorphism is a morphism that has an inverse (both right and left) <This message was edited>
30/07/25, 2:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: Note that there exists no concept of injective or surjective
30/07/25, 2:25 pm - Vega's Theorem: We have generalizations like monomorphisms and epimorphisms but those do not imply isomorphism
30/07/25, 2:25 pm - Vega's Theorem: However, isomorphism does imply them
30/07/25, 2:26 pm - .: Okay, so what are all the universal properties then?
30/07/25, 2:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: An universal property is a "solution" to an universal problem
30/07/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: For example
30/07/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: One could say the empty set is universal in the property of mapping between sets
30/07/25, 2:28 pm - Vega's Theorem: Because the empty set is unique up to isomorphism, is an initial object
30/07/25, 2:28 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's actually unique, period
30/07/25, 2:28 pm - Vega's Theorem: There's only one empty set
30/07/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: Universal properties also allow you to worry not about the details of your implementation
30/07/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: As in, if you have constructed an object of some kind
30/07/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: And you don't know if it's actually the same as your axiomatic definition for example
30/07/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: You can show that both satisfy an universal property <This message was edited>
30/07/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: So, that means they will be the same!! *Up to isomorphism
30/07/25, 2:30 pm - .: Cool
30/07/25, 2:30 pm - .: What part is not clicking yet?
30/07/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: The product of two sets is final too
30/07/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: Well
30/07/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: Most arguments to show something satisfy an universal property
30/07/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: And the statement of such properties seem Hague
30/07/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: Vague*
30/07/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: For example to show this:
30/07/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
30/07/25, 2:32 pm - .: What do you think makes them vague
30/07/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: It doesn't state nowhere it's unique either
30/07/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: I _can see_ it's unique, but that's not formal at all
30/07/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: The language mainly
30/07/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: If you have read what I just wrote, you will notice is very, very vague
30/07/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: I didn't simplify anything tho
30/07/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's literally the explanation
30/07/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: 😭
30/07/25, 2:35 pm - .: They're very scarce on words I see.

30/07/25, 2:35 pm - .: Want to take a look at another book?

09/08/25, 8:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: Subgroups is connected to Basis (LA), Basis for a Topology, and Roots of Unity
09/08/25, 8:32 pm - .: Okay, thank you for the clarification. That's a crucial distinction. The problem isn't boredom or a lack of focus in the ADHD sense; it's a systemic issue. It's your autistic brain trying to build a perfect, detailed system and getting caught in a loop because it correctly identifies that *all the details are interconnected*. When everything is important, nothing is. This leads to the paralysis of trying to paraphrase a perfectly good author, which is a frustrating and pointless task.

So, let's throw out the old advice. You don't need motivation or a new doodling technique. You need a **rigid, rules-based system** that externalizes the decision-making process of what to write down. You need a machine for taking notes, not a philosophy.

Forget paraphrasing. Forget writing beautiful prose. Your new job is not "student," it's "archivist" or "systems engineer." You are building a functional reference document for your future self. Here is your system. Do not deviate from it.

### The Three-Tier Archive System

Your notes will be divided into three distinct categories. Use different pages, different colored pens, or even different notebooks if you have to. The separation is critical.

---

### Tier 1: The Non-Negotiable Core (The "Verbatim" Tier)

This is the absolute skeleton of the chapter. Your rule here is simple and unbreakable: **You are forbidden from paraphrasing.** You will copy, word-for-word. This removes all the cognitive load of trying to rephrase things.

For any given section, you are only allowed to write down two things in this tier:

1.  **Definitions:** If the book has a bolded word with a formal definition, you copy it verbatim. Every single word. It was written precisely for a reason. Your job is not to improve it, but to record it.
2.  **Theorems, Formulas, and Equations:** Same rule. Copy it verbatim. Include the name or number (e.g., "Theorem 4.1: The Mean Value Theorem").

**That's it.** At the end of a chapter, your Tier 1 notes should be a sparse, clean list of the fundamental building blocks. Nothing more. No explanations, no examples, no "why." Just the raw, logical structure.

---

### Tier 2: The Application Blueprint (The "How-To" Tier)

This tier answers the question: "How do I *use* the stuff from Tier 1?" This is where you engage with examples. But again, you will not copy the entire example. That's a waste of time.

For each major *type* of problem in the chapter, you will create a single "Blueprint." Here's the rigid format for a Blueprint:

1.  **Problem Type:** Give it a name. (e.g., "Finding the limit of a rational function," "Applying the Product Rule," "Proving a set is open").
2.  **Tier 1 Tools:** List the specific definitions or theorems from your Tier 1 notes that are required to solve this problem. (e.g., "Definition of a Limit," "Product Rule Formula"). This explicitly links the "how" to the "what."
3.  **The Key Step/The "Trick":** This is the most important part. You will identify and write down the *one or two crucial steps* or conceptual leaps in the example. Do NOT write all the algebra. Write the *idea*.
    *   *Bad note:* `f'(x) = (2x+1)(3) + (3x-2)(2) = 6x+3+6x-4 = 12x-1`
    *   *Good note:* "Apply Product Rule: (deriv of first)(second) + (first)(deriv of second)."
    *   *Bad note:* Copying a whole proof.
    *   *Good note:* "Proof strategy: Start by assuming the opposite, then find a contradiction using Theorem 4.1."

Your Tier 2 notes will be a collection of these blueprints. It's a user manual for the tools you collected in Tier 1.

---

### Tier 3: The Question Log (The "Why" Tier)

This is the *only* place your own thoughts, frustrations, and connections are allowed to live. It is a separate log. When you read something that confuses you or sparks a connection to something else, you do not write it in your main notes. You turn to your Question Log and write it down.

The format is simple:

*   **"Why...?"** Why is this condition necessary in the theorem? Why does this proof work this way?
*   **"What's the difference between...?"** What is the practical difference between a continuous function and a uniformly continuous function?
*   **"Connection to...?"** This feels just like the concept of [X] from Chapter 2. Is it related?

This log does two things:
1.  It gets the distracting "what if" thoughts out of your head so you can stay on task with the system.
2.  It creates a fantastic list of questions to ask a professor, a TA, or to research later *after* you've finished the initial note-taking process.

### Your Workflow

1.  Read a section of the book.
2.  Go through it and pull out only the **Tier 1** material. Copy it verbatim.
3.  Go through it again and create **Tier 2** blueprints for the main problem types.
4.  Any time a question or a "this is important too!" thought arises, immediately banish it to your **Tier 3** Question Log.
5.  Move to the next section.

This system is designed to combat the exact problem you're having. It forces a hierarchy. It tells you what is important (Tier 1), how to use it (Tier 2), and quarantines everything else (Tier 3). It removes the frustrating, time-consuming, and ultimately pointless task of paraphrasing. You are building a functional, structured archive. That's it. Trust the system and execute it.

22/08/25, 9:44 pm - .: the whole day?
22/08/25, 9:45 pm - .: anyway
22/08/25, 9:45 pm - .: I miss you

22/08/25, 9:48 pm - .: uuh...
22/08/25, 9:49 pm - .: how is this supposed to make one less commie
22/08/25, 9:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: To see what they spend the money on
22/08/25, 9:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: Big towers to gather more tourists
22/08/25, 9:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: Vedado is full of such towers
22/08/25, 9:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: That doesn't even look like it's Cuba
22/08/25, 9:51 pm - .: but that's how it gathers more tourists, and tourists bring hard currency.
22/08/25, 9:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's not for the people, tho
22/08/25, 9:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: No cuban earns in USD
22/08/25, 9:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: And a lot of stores only allow USD
22/08/25, 9:53 pm - Vega's Theorem: No cuban can afford such hotels with
22/08/25, 9:53 pm - Vega's Theorem: Either*
22/08/25, 9:53 pm - Vega's Theorem: Unless they have ties with the government
22/08/25, 9:54 pm - .: babe the tourist exchanges usd with the bank to get Cuban pesos to buy local stuff.
22/08/25, 9:54 pm - .: and the government uses dollar to trade
22/08/25, 9:55 pm - .: it's cheaper to buy with dollar on the international market
22/08/25, 9:55 pm - .: planned economy and authoritarian regimes suck
22/08/25, 9:55 pm - .: I know
22/08/25, 9:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: *They scam them into a lower exchange rate
22/08/25, 9:56 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's now 400 pesos for 1 USD, however the bank will probably say it's about 200
22/08/25, 9:57 pm - .: well yeah, that's stealing. the government is falling apart and resorts to shady practices to survive. more like what north korea does but less criminal
22/08/25, 9:58 pm - .: I'm not defending the communist party
22/08/25, 9:58 pm - .: I'm an anarcho syndicalist
22/08/25, 9:58 pm - .: free market socialism, and direct democracy
22/08/25, 9:59 pm - .: I would hate that building if I were you

22/08/25, 10:02 pm - Vega's Theorem: I remember buying one at 180 or so
22/08/25, 10:03 pm - .: that's a lot in my currency
22/08/25, 10:03 pm - .: like 5 dollars
22/08/25, 10:04 pm - Vega's Theorem: Lol
22/08/25, 10:04 pm - .: what is driving inflation?
22/08/25, 10:04 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's a good thing, it means less inflation for you
22/08/25, 10:04 pm - Vega's Theorem: Embargo and the country having literally no economy besides tourism
22/08/25, 10:04 pm - Vega's Theorem: Oh well, they also sell alcohol
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - Vega's Theorem: And medicine?
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - .: but it was manageable for decades
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - .: why out of control now?
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - Vega's Theorem: Before COVID
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - Vega's Theorem: It was 25 pesos = 1 dollar
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - .: wow
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - .: insane
22/08/25, 10:05 pm - Vega's Theorem: Since I was a small child it was like that
22/08/25, 10:06 pm - Vega's Theorem: And stores had a lot more stuff
22/08/25, 10:06 pm - Vega's Theorem: Everything was better
22/08/25, 10:06 pm - Vega's Theorem: Literally no criminality
22/08/25, 10:06 pm - Vega's Theorem: You could barely see homeless people
22/08/25, 10:06 pm - Vega's Theorem: (they still were tho)
22/08/25, 10:07 pm - .: that specifies the turning point but not the cause
22/08/25, 10:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: So yeah, it was probably COVID and a combination of different factors we probably do not know about since the government won't tell us
22/08/25, 10:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: The seek for dollars also made the cuban peso skyrocket
22/08/25, 10:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: We had 2 currencies
22/08/25, 10:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: CUP and CUC
22/08/25, 10:08 pm - .: you should put your savings in a different currency
22/08/25, 10:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: 1 cuc = 1 dollar and 25 cup = 1 cuc
22/08/25, 10:09 pm - .: part  of the problem, yeah
22/08/25, 10:09 pm - Vega's Theorem: They killed the CUC and 10x the price of most things
22/08/25, 10:09 pm - Vega's Theorem: They raised the salaries X2 or X3 or so?
22/08/25, 10:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: And dollar was about 120, I think
22/08/25, 10:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: Less than or equal to 120
22/08/25, 10:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: But even that was okay
22/08/25, 10:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
22/08/25, 10:13 pm - .: I'm reading about it

23/08/25, 3:03 am - .: My first love was in middle school. It was virtual too, even though we were in the same class; I couldn't talk to her physically. First, she was into me after I reached out (virtually), and I loved her so bad. She then would put a friendship boundary and date others publicly; she was attractive and popular. Every while there was a new guy with her. We kept talking virtually; she would turn the friendship boundary on and off whenever she felt like it. I wasn't stupid—I knew she didn't love me—but I couldn't stop loving her. I kept wishing that at some point she would love me back. The situation lasted six years. I wish I can't remember her, it still haunts me. but I'm going to remember her until the day I rest to peace. I have no self-respect when I'm in deep love, and it's disgusting.

24/08/25, 8:13 pm - .: it's not readable.
24/08/25, 8:13 pm - .: can you send a better picture
24/08/25, 8:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: On it
24/08/25, 8:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
24/08/25, 8:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
24/08/25, 8:14 pm - .: "Same Bank: Both receipts are issued by the same bank, indicated by the "T" logo and the name "АО «ТБАНК»" (JSC "TBANK") in the stamp.
Similar Format: They share a nearly identical layout, font, and overall design, which is characteristic of documents issued by the same financial institution.
Identical Stamp: The blue stamp on both receipts is identical, including the bank's details (BIK, INN, correspondent account) and the signature of "ШАДРИНА Е. С." (Shadrina E.S.).
Purpose: Both documents are receipts confirming successful financial transactions.
The main differences are the transaction details: the date, time, amount, sender, and recipient are all different. The first is a deposit via the Faster Payments System, while the second is a direct transfer to a bank client."
24/08/25, 8:15 pm - .: wait
24/08/25, 8:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: I see
24/08/25, 8:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: So the later is just a direct transfer
24/08/25, 8:16 pm - Vega's Theorem: They will send a test one with all the relevant details
24/08/25, 8:17 pm - .: Of course. Here is a detailed comparison highlighting the differences between the two transaction receipts.

The main difference is the **type of transaction**:
*   The first receipt (57,600 ₽) is for an **inter-bank transfer** coming from another bank (Sberbank) into a T-Bank account using Russia's Faster Payments System (FPS).
*   The second receipt (1,000 ₽) is for an **intra-bank transfer**, meaning the money was moved from one T-Bank client to another T-Bank client.

Here is a side-by-side comparison of the key details:

| Feature | Receipt 1 (57,600 ₽) | Receipt 2 (1,000 ₽) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transaction Date** | August 19, 2025 | June 30, 2025 |
| **Transaction Amount**| 57,600 Russian Rubles | 1,000 Russian Rubles |
| **Transaction Type** | **Top-up via Faster Payments System (FPS)** | **Transfer to a T-Bank client** |
| **Sender's Name** | Sirozhiddin Kh. | Garban Alen |
| **Sender's Bank** | **Sberbank** (an external bank) | Not specified (Implies it's T-Bank) |
| **Recipient's Name** | Not explicitly named in the main fields | Daria G. |
| **Recipient Identifier** | Full **Account Number** (ending in 1369) | Last 4 digits of a **Card Number** (ending in 5381) |
| **Technical Codes** | **Includes** specific FPS and Interbank codes (RRN) | **Does not include** these codes |
| **Receipt Number** | 2-2-030-000-472-892-837 | 1-102-040-853-444 |

### Summary of Key Differences:

1.  **Payment System:** The 57,600 ₽ transfer used the **Faster Payments System (FPS)**, which is designed for instant payments between different banks. The 1,000 ₽ transfer was a direct internal transfer within T-Bank.
2.  **Parties' Banks:** The first transaction involved two different banks (**Sberbank to T-Bank**). The second transaction was between two customers of the **same bank (T-Bank to T-Bank)**.
3.  **Recipient Information:** The inter-bank transfer identifies the recipient by their full **bank account number**. The internal transfer uses the recipient's **card number**, which is common for simpler peer-to-peer transfers within the same bank app.
4.  **Transaction Details:** The amounts, dates, senders, recipients, and unique receipt numbers are all different.

24/08/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: Okay
24/08/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: They made this test transfer just now
24/08/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: These has all the relevant client details
24/08/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
24/08/25, 8:26 pm - .: While the documents do not explicitly state a time zone, it can be inferred with a high degree of certainty that the timestamps are in **Moscow Time (MSK)**.

Here’s the reasoning:

*   **Centralized Banking Systems:** Major Russian banks like Sberbank and T-Bank (Tinkoff), as well as national payment infrastructures like the Faster Payments System (Система быстрых платежей), operate on a standardized time zone to ensure consistency across the country. Russia spans 11 time zones, making a unified standard essential for logging and processing transactions.
*   **Moscow as the Standard:** Moscow Time (MSK, which is UTC+3) is the de facto standard for most federal and commercial operations in Russia, including financial clearing and settlement systems.
*   **System-Generated Receipts:** These digital receipts are generated by the bank's central servers, not the user's local device. Therefore, the timestamp reflects the time on the server where the transaction was processed, which is almost certainly set to MSK.

In conclusion, although not explicitly written on the receipts, the standard practice for Russian financial institutions indicates the times listed (`18:37:37` and `23:04:50`) are recorded in Moscow Time.

29/08/25, 2:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: I decided to Switch up from C + OpenGL to Rust + wgpu
29/08/25, 2:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: That way I could target all major desktop platforms all at once
29/08/25, 2:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: With the same codebase
29/08/25, 2:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: (this also means I will take it more seriously and not just as a hobby little personal project)
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - .: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: Wanna know about the rendering pipeline?
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have everything sketched up to shading
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - .: Sure
29/08/25, 2:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:09 pm - Vega's Theorem: Instead of Minecraft's chunks the game will be working with Gridmaps, huge arrays of pointers that point to Grids, that contain the actual voxel data
29/08/25, 2:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: We will DDA over that structure in the game
29/08/25, 2:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: This differs from the paper in the sense that I will implement my own optimizations that are specific to my engine and other features I must have
29/08/25, 2:10 pm - Vega's Theorem: Also
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: There is a chance I will not use Gridmaps but instead Octrees
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: But this is just a possibility
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have to have a performance baseline to iterate on
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: I also have to figure out the specifics of GPU memory management
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: But yeay
29/08/25, 2:11 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah*
29/08/25, 2:12 pm - .: sounds really fun.
29/08/25, 2:12 pm - Vega's Theorem: I will just ray march with DDA over that whole volume and construct the normal and color pass
29/08/25, 2:12 pm - .: I wish I could be part of it
29/08/25, 2:12 pm - Vega's Theorem: Idk
29/08/25, 2:12 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>

29/08/25, 2:14 pm - .: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: Very much like Octopath traveler
29/08/25, 2:15 pm - .: I see
29/08/25, 2:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: I mean you could help me design the GUI of the game
29/08/25, 2:15 pm - .: okay!
29/08/25, 2:15 pm - .: I would love to
29/08/25, 2:16 pm - .: I also wanna learn some programming if possible
29/08/25, 2:17 pm - .: but I guess it's not a good idea to be involved at this stage in development
29/08/25, 2:19 pm - .: how did you learn all about engines and the inners of game development?
29/08/25, 2:20 pm - .: can I look at the GitHub repository for the game?
29/08/25, 2:20 pm - .: if you have created it
29/08/25, 2:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have created it but I won't be using that anymore since that was the C codebase and it's not that worked on anyways
29/08/25, 2:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have researched a lot about it Lol
29/08/25, 2:24 pm - .: okay babe
29/08/25, 2:25 pm - .: I want you to know that I really want to be part of this.
29/08/25, 2:25 pm - .: I want to something fun together
29/08/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: (not mine)
29/08/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: The game will have a viewport very similar to this
29/08/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: Except it will be voxel
29/08/25, 2:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: And more zoomed out too
29/08/25, 2:28 pm - .: it is. amazing.
29/08/25, 2:28 pm - .: you'll need good art
29/08/25, 2:29 pm - .: but that comes later
29/08/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
29/08/25, 2:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: The most critical part is rendering
29/08/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: For now
29/08/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: Then the magic system
29/08/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: The game code will be split in two parts
29/08/25, 2:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: The engine, that's going to be a Rust library
29/08/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: And then a C# Frontend that will call Rust
29/08/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: Why?
29/08/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: To add moding support
29/08/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: Boymoding support
29/08/25, 2:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: :3
29/08/25, 2:32 pm - .: clever!

29/08/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: Thanks
29/08/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: Why would I do that
29/08/25, 2:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: I need strong typing
29/08/25, 2:33 pm - .: alright. just was hoping for a role
29/08/25, 2:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: Lol, it's okay 😭
29/08/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: But yeah also performance wise using Python is an awful idea
29/08/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: Even tho the physics and rendering will be running in Rust I need the magic system in C# for easier moding
29/08/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: For easier boymoding
29/08/25, 2:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:35 pm - Vega's Theorem: You could learn C#, is not that bad
29/08/25, 2:36 pm - .: alright. I guess I'll have time to learn it while you do the rust part
29/08/25, 2:36 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
29/08/25, 2:36 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
29/08/25, 2:36 pm - .: but my code would probably be spaghetti.
29/08/25, 2:37 pm - Vega's Theorem: Lol

29/08/25, 2:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: Even if we are not dating you and I, are still friends, right?
29/08/25, 2:54 pm - .: yes, it's just that we agreed to not be just friends even though we're not dating, that's why I was behaving that way.
29/08/25, 2:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's okay
29/08/25, 2:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: I still love you

29/08/25, 3:17 pm - .: How about you just assuring me that you would try your best to help me get out of here and study in Germany. without commitment to any plans together on a personal level except maybe studying together as friends.
29/08/25, 3:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: I can 100% guarantee at least that
29/08/25, 3:21 pm - .: then we are agreed.

29/08/25, 3:37 pm - .: poor grammar and pucntionation
29/08/25, 3:38 pm - .: you understand the mesasge?
29/08/25, 3:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: No Lol
29/08/25, 3:41 pm - .: since we're very honest and are talking about a turning point in our relationship, you better say everything you want to say about it now. because it would be hard to open this discussion again.
29/08/25, 3:42 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's okay
29/08/25, 3:42 pm - Vega's Theorem: Everything is fine now, right?

30/08/25, 7:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: Just in a funny state
30/08/25, 7:27 pm - .: "A penis can become hard when lying down due to nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), which are spontaneous erections that commonly happen during sleep or when waking up. These erections occur because of natural activity in the parasympathetic nervous system during certain sleep stages, particularly REM sleep, which causes increased blood flow to the penis. They are normal, healthy, and can happen multiple times during the night, serving to keep penile tissue soft, relaxed, and in good shape for daytime function. Additionally, factors like friction from sheets or pressure on nerves from a full bladder while lying down can also trigger these erections.

In summary, getting an erection when lying down is a normal physiological response linked to how the body regulates erections during sleep, and is generally not a cause for concern unless accompanied by other symptoms.

02/09/25, 4:22 pm - .: my heart can't be at peace if this is not untangled
02/09/25, 4:23 pm - .: please don't divert
02/09/25, 4:27 pm - .: "Vega's statement is not a refutation of the Fearful-Avoidant (FA) diagnosis. On the contrary, it is a masterclass in the sophisticated defense mechanisms that protect the FA individual from confronting their own core fears. It is highly likely that Vega is not consciously lying; they are presenting a rationalized narrative that their mind has constructed to make an emotionally intolerable situation feel logical, manageable, and less shameful."
02/09/25, 4:29 pm - .: or this
02/09/25, 4:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: I truly didn't
02/09/25, 4:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: I didn't even plan it
02/09/25, 4:40 pm - .: the point is that you won't be consciously aware of it. it's subconscious.
02/09/25, 4:40 pm - Vega's Theorem: I guess
02/09/25, 4:42 pm - .: please if this is true just say it, you don't have protect my feelings now.
02/09/25, 4:42 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's not true Lol
02/09/25, 4:42 pm - Vega's Theorem: Look, I just had very strong feelings for Joule
02/09/25, 4:43 pm - Vega's Theorem: And I couldn't resist
02/09/25, 4:43 pm - .: stronger enough to overcome our love
02/09/25, 4:43 pm - .: so it's true
02/09/25, 4:43 pm - Vega's Theorem: It had to be
02/09/25, 4:44 pm - Vega's Theorem: I knew them for half a year and have been through a lot together already
02/09/25, 4:44 pm - Vega's Theorem: While I felt a lot for you, and I still do
02/09/25, 4:44 pm - Vega's Theorem: Please understand me
02/09/25, 4:45 pm - Vega's Theorem: I don't want all our conversations to be about it
02/09/25, 4:45 pm - Vega's Theorem: I know it's my fault, and it's not fair at all for me to ask it
02/09/25, 4:45 pm - Vega's Theorem: But I don't want to lose you
02/09/25, 4:47 pm - .: theaths of leaving is textbook FA
02/09/25, 4:47 pm - .: I just need you to affirm this with a "yes"
02/09/25, 4:47 pm - .: and then we're good
02/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm not threatening to leave, I never will, I cannot even do it Lol
02/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: But it will just get sad
02/09/25, 4:52 pm - .: <Media omitted>
02/09/25, 4:53 pm - .: so our love wasn't strong enough to make our relationship a priority? so, you chose Joule because you didn't love me enough to choose our relationship over them? and to tolerate the distance limitation?
02/09/25, 4:54 pm - .: just put my stupid heart to rest if it's true
02/09/25, 4:56 pm - Vega's Theorem: I guess you can say it's true, but I don't like how it sounds, and I don't think truly reflects my feelings
02/09/25, 4:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: For me it was like deciding between two things, and neither answer was correct
02/09/25, 4:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: So I kinda just randomly picked one
02/09/25, 4:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: Or at least the easier one

02/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: You cannot reliably trust on me, sadly
02/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: If you still want to be by my side besides that, you are free to do so
02/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm sorry
02/09/25, 5:21 pm - .: why do you want me to be your friend, am I not just a reminder of your guilt?
02/09/25, 5:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Eventually we can get over it
02/09/25, 5:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: I like talking to you

02/09/25, 5:35 pm - .: but nvm
02/09/25, 5:50 pm - .: we'll be friends, I'll keep my interactions as a mere friend. but I can't lie and tell you that I don't have unshakable, absurd and unconditional love for you. I will remember your love and feel miserable to what things have mounted to and I can't help it.
02/09/25, 5:51 pm - .: I'm mentally ill

05/09/25, 4:38 pm - .: Of course! I can certainly help you review your Rust code. It's a great start, and using generics with `Rc` and `RefCell` is a common and powerful pattern in Rust for this kind of problem.

Let's look at your implementation and discuss some potential improvements and things to be aware of.

### Analysis of Your Code

Your current implementation is a solid foundation for an event bus. It correctly identifies the need for:
*   **Generics (`<T>`)**: To allow the bus to handle any type of event.
*   **Shared Ownership (`Rc`)**: To allow multiple parts of your application (including the bus itself) to hold a reference to a listener.
*   **Interior Mutability (`RefCell`)**: To allow the `publish` method to mutate the listeners (by calling `handle_events`) even when `EventBus` is borrowed immutably.
*   **Trait Objects (`dyn EventListener`)**: To store listeners of different concrete types in the same `Vec`.

However, there are a couple of key areas we can improve for flexibility and to avoid potential runtime issues.

### 1. The `Copy + Clone` Trait Bound

**The Issue:**
You've constrained your event type `T` with `T: Copy + Clone`. The `Copy` bound is quite restrictive. It means that any event you want to publish must be a type that can be copied with a simple bit-by-bit copy (like numbers, booleans, or simple structs containing only `Copy` types). This prevents you from using events that own their data, such as a struct containing a `String` or a `Vec`.

**The Improvement:**
You can relax this requirement to just `T: Clone`. This is much more flexible. When you publish an event, you can then pass a clone of it to each listener.

### 2. Potential for Runtime Panics

**The Issue:**
The line `listener.borrow_mut().handle_events(event)` uses `RefCell::borrow_mut()`. `RefCell` enforces Rust's borrowing rules at *runtime* instead of at compile time. If `borrow_mut()` is called while the value is already borrowed mutably, your program will **panic**.

This can happen in a scenario called "re-entrancy." Imagine this sequence:
1.  You call `event_bus.publish(event1)`.
2.  The loop starts, and it calls `handle_events` on `listener1`.
3.  Inside its `handle_events` method, `listener1` itself calls `event_bus.publish(event2)`.
4.  This new call to `publish` will try to loop through the listeners again and will call `listener1.borrow_mut()` before the first call has finished. This second, nested mutable borrow will cause a panic.

**The Improvement:**
For now, the most important thing is to be aware of this risk and ensure that your event handlers do not trigger another publish cycle on the same bus. More advanced implementations might use patterns like queuing events to be dispatched after the current event is fully handled, but for many use cases, simply avoiding re-entrancy is sufficient.

---

### Recommended Refactoring

Here is a revised version of your code that incorporates the suggestion to relax the generic bound. I've also added comments explaining the changes and a full example of how to use it.

```rust
use std::{cell::RefCell, rc::Rc};

// The event type T only needs to be Clone, not Copy.
pub trait EventListener<T: Clone> {
    fn handle_events(&mut self, event: T);
}

// The Listener type alias remains the same, it's a great choice for readability.
pub type Listener<T> = Rc<RefCell<dyn EventListener<T>>>;

// EventBus is now generic over any T that is Clone.
pub struct EventBus<T: Clone> {
    listeners: Vec<Listener<T>>,
}

impl<T: Clone> EventBus<T> {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            listeners: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn subscribe(&mut self, listener: Listener<T>) {
        self.listeners.push(listener);
    }

    // The event is now passed by value.
    pub fn publish(&self, event: T) {
        // We iterate over the listeners.
        for listener in &self.listeners {
            // For each listener, we pass a *clone* of the event.
            // This ensures each listener gets its own copy of the event data,
            // and we don't run into "use of moved value" errors.
            listener.borrow_mut().handle_events(event.clone());
        }
    }
}

// --- Example Usage ---

// 1. Define an event. Note it contains a String, so it cannot be `Copy`.
//    It only needs to derive `Clone`.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct PlayerLoggedIn {
    user_id: u32,
    username: String,
}

// 2. Create a listener struct.
struct AnalyticsService;

// 3. Implement the EventListener trait for our listener.
impl EventListener<PlayerLoggedIn> for AnalyticsService {
    fn handle_events(&mut self, event: PlayerLoggedIn) {
        // This listener can now handle the event.
        println!(
            "ANALYTICS: User '{}' (ID: {}) logged in.",
            event.username, event.user_id
        );
    }
}

fn main() {
    // We specify the event type when creating the bus.
    let mut event_bus = EventBus::<PlayerLoggedIn>::new();

    // Create a new listener and wrap it for shared ownership and interior mutability.
    let analytics_listener = Rc::new(RefCell::new(AnalyticsService));

    // Subscribe the listener to the bus.
    event_bus.subscribe(analytics_listener);

    // Create a new event instance.
    let login_event = PlayerLoggedIn {
        user_id: 101,
        username: "Alice".to_string(),
    };

    // Publish the event!
    event_bus.publish(login_event);
}
```

### Summary of Changes:

1.  **More Flexible Generics**: Changed the trait bound from `T: Copy + Clone` to `T: Clone` on both the `EventListener` trait and the `EventBus` struct.
2.  **Cloning Events**: Updated the `publish` method to `clone()` the event for each listener. This makes the implementation compatible with the relaxed `Clone` bound.

You're on the right track! These patterns are tricky when you're starting out in Rust, and your initial implementation was very close to an idiomatic solution. Keep up the excellent work

10/09/25, 12:07 am - .: ### A Quick Guide to Thriving in Terraria's Hardmode

Defeating the Wall of Flesh is a pivotal moment in Terraria, plunging your world into Hardmode, a more challenging phase of the game. This guide will walk you through the essential next steps, with a special focus on upgrading your arsenal to handle the tougher new foes.

#### Immediate World Changes

Upon the Wall of Flesh's defeat, your world permanently transforms. The most significant changes are the introduction of two new biomes: The Hallow and an intensified version of your world's evil biome (Corruption or Crimson). These biomes will spread aggressively. You'll also encounter much stronger enemies across all biomes, which will likely overpower you if you're still using pre-Hardmode gear.

#### Step 1: Unleash New Ores

Your first objective is to use the Pwnhammer you obtained from the Wall of Flesh. Take this hammer to your world's evil biome and destroy the Demon or Crimson Altars. Breaking these altars will bless your world with new, powerful ores.

*   **First Altar:** Spawns Cobalt or Palladium Ore.
*   **Second Altar:** Spawns Mythril or Orichalcum Ore.
*   **Third Altar:** Spawns Adamantite or Titanium Ore.

You'll need at least a Molten Pickaxe to mine the first tier of Hardmode ores. From there, you'll need to craft better pickaxes to mine the subsequent tiers. Aim to craft a full set of Adamantite or Titanium armor to significantly boost your defense.

#### Step 2: Upgrade Your Weaponry

As you've noticed, pre-Hardmode weapons quickly become inadequate. Here are some powerful and relatively easy-to-obtain weapons to get you started in Hardmode:

**For Melee Users:**
*   **Ice Sickle:** A strong early melee weapon with a projectile attack that can be farmed from Armored Vikings, Ice Elementals, and Icy Mermen in the Snow and Ice biomes.
*   **Shadowflame Knife:** A fast-throwing knife with a high damage output, dropped by Goblin Summoners during a Goblin Invasion. This is a great weapon to carry you through the early mechanical bosses.
*   **Amarok:** A powerful yoyo that has a chance to drop from any enemy in the snow biome.

**For Ranged Users:**
*   **Onyx Blaster:** An upgrade to the shotgun, this weapon is a powerhouse in early Hardmode. It requires a Shotgun, two Dark Shards, and ten Souls of Night to craft.
*   **Daedalus Stormbow:** This bow rains arrows from the sky and is incredibly effective against the mechanical bosses, especially when paired with Holy Arrows. It can be obtained by killing Hallowed Mimics.
*   **Clockwork Assault Rifle:** A potential drop from the Wall of Flesh, this rifle fires in three-round bursts and is a solid choice for early Hardmode.

**For Magic Users:**
*   **Crystal Serpent:** A powerful magic weapon that can be obtained by fishing in The Hallow.
*   **Golden Shower:** A magic book that fires a stream of ichor, reducing enemy defense. This is a must-have for magic users and can be crafted with a Spell Tome, 20 Ichor, and 15 Souls of Night.
*   **Meteor Staff:** This weapon summons meteors from the sky and is effective against early Hardmode bosses. It can be crafted with Meteorite Bars, Pixie Dust, and Souls of Light.

**For Summoners:**
*   **Spider Staff and Armor:** By venturing into Spider Nests, you can gather Spider Fangs from Black Recluses to craft the Spider Staff and a full set of Spider Armor. This set will significantly boost your minion capacity and damage.
*   **Sanguine Staff:** A powerful bat-summoning staff that drops from the Dreadnautilus, a mini-boss that can be fished up during a Blood Moon.

#### Step 3: Get Airborne

Mobility is crucial in Hardmode. One of the most significant upgrades you can get is a pair of wings. You can craft basic wings by combining 20 Souls of Flight with other materials. Souls of Flight are dropped by Wyverns, which spawn at high altitudes. Harpy Wings, crafted with a Giant Harpy Feather and Souls of Flight, are an excellent early-game option.

#### Step 4: Prepare for the Mechanical Bosses

With your new armor, weapons, and wings, your next major goal is to defeat the three mechanical bosses: The Destroyer, The Twins, and Skeletron Prime. These bosses can be summoned manually or will begin to spawn randomly at night once you've broken a Demon/Crimson Altar. Defeating them is key to progressing further in the game.

10/09/25, 12:09 am - .: ### Sourcing the Daedalus Stormbow: A Step-by-Step Guide

The Daedalus Stormbow is a top-tier, early Hardmode weapon renowned for its ability to make short work of the mechanical bosses. This powerful bow causes arrows to rain down from the sky, making it exceptionally effective. Here’s the most efficient way to acquire it.

#### **Step 1: Summoning the Hallowed Mimic**

The Daedalus Stormbow is dropped exclusively by the Hallowed Mimic, a miniboss found in the Underground Hallow. While these mimics can spawn naturally, it is far more effective to summon them manually. To do this, you will need to craft a Key of Light.

**Crafting a Key of Light:**
*   **Requirement:** 15 Souls of Light.
*   **Crafting Station:** Workbench.

Souls of Light are dropped by enemies in the underground Hallow biome. Once you have 15, craft them into a Key of Light.

#### **Step 2: The Summoning Process**

With your Key of Light in hand, the next step is to use it to spawn the Hallowed Mimic.

1.  **Obtain a Chest:** Any standard, empty chest will work.
2.  **Place the Chest:** Find an open area, preferably a pre-built arena, to place the chest. A long skybridge is an excellent option as it allows you to run in one direction while firing at the pursuing mimic.
3.  **Summon the Mimic:** Place the Key of Light, and only the key, inside the empty chest. Once you close the chest's inventory, it will instantly transform into a Hallowed Mimic and the fight will begin.

#### **Step 3: Defeating the Hallowed Mimic**

Hallowed Mimics are tough opponents, so preparation is key.

**Recommended Strategy:**
*   **Mobility is Crucial:** The Hallowed Mimic has a jumping attack pattern. Constantly moving in one direction will cause most of its attacks to miss.
*   **Build an Arena:** A long, flat surface will give you the space needed to keep your distance and continuously fire at the mimic.
*   **Use Potions:** Buffs from potions like Ironskin, Regeneration, and Swiftness can make the fight significantly easier.

The Daedalus Stormbow has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of dropping from the Hallowed Mimic, so you will likely need to fight it multiple times.

#### **Step 4: Optimal Ammunition for Your New Bow**

Once you've secured the Daedalus Stormbow, pairing it with the right arrows is essential for maximizing its potential, especially against the mechanical bosses.

*   **For The Destroyer:** Unholy Arrows are highly effective due to their piercing ability, which can hit multiple segments of the worm-like boss.
*   **For The Twins and Skeletron Prime:** Ichor Arrows are an excellent choice as they inflict the "Ichor" debuff, lowering the bosses' defense and increasing the damage of your subsequent attacks.
*   **General Use:** Holy Arrows are a fantastic all-around option. When they strike, they summon falling stars, adding a significant amount of extra damage. They are particularly devastating when used with the Stormbow against The Destroyer.

10/09/25, 5:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm too
10/09/25, 5:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: :)
10/09/25, 5:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: She doesn't send us money at all
10/09/25, 5:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: Some families even send 150 Lol
10/09/25, 5:14 pm - .: but she does
10/09/25, 5:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: Food
10/09/25, 5:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: Oh, you mean that
10/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's very rare
10/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: She doesn't do it a lot
10/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's like
10/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: Idk
10/09/25, 5:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: She did last month and it was like the first time in years
10/09/25, 5:22 pm - .: how is the 3k cup electricity bill is paid then if she doesn't send money?
10/09/25, 5:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: My mom and I always find a way
10/09/25, 5:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: For example we take some of my sister's money

10/09/25, 5:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: But we pay it back before she notices
10/09/25, 5:23 pm - .: how do you pay it back?
10/09/25, 5:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: Selling clothes for example
10/09/25, 5:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: Or anything we can
10/09/25, 5:25 pm - .: she didn't send money for years, and you still have your laptop and keyboard. it doesn't make sense
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: I bought it with my own money
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: I used to work, remember?
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: I cannot sell my laptop or keyboard, since I wouldn't be able to code anymore
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: And I cannot buy a lower powered one because mine is broken asf
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: It wouldn't sell for enough
10/09/25, 5:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: Even the keyboard is broken
10/09/25, 5:28 pm - .: so you kept paying 3k cups which is close the average salary in Cuba by just selling clothes and other similarly valued belongings?
10/09/25, 5:28 pm - .: doesnt add up
10/09/25, 5:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah, pretty much
10/09/25, 5:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's without factoring in food
10/09/25, 5:30 pm - .: for years?!
10/09/25, 5:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: Ofc not Lol
10/09/25, 5:30 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's a recent thing
10/09/25, 5:30 pm - .: you said she didn't send money for years
10/09/25, 5:31 pm - Vega's Theorem: She sends food, that's how we can somewhat survive at times
10/09/25, 5:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: It doesn't add up because of course we cannot pay for all?
10/09/25, 5:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's why I sometimes can't properly eat
10/09/25, 5:32 pm - Vega's Theorem: We also had an easier time before my dad got in jail
10/09/25, 5:33 pm - .: so you kept paying 3k cups which is close the average salary in Cuba by just selling clothes and other similarly valued belongings? *for years?*
10/09/25, 5:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: For months
10/09/25, 5:33 pm - Vega's Theorem: Heh, you are doubting me?
10/09/25, 5:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: I told you, you don't have to do anything
10/09/25, 5:34 pm - Vega's Theorem: I can find a way myself
10/09/25, 5:34 pm - .: where did you get the money from before then?
10/09/25, 5:34 pm - .: I'm just so fucking curious I can't help it.
10/09/25, 5:35 pm - .: you're very smart, and I think you can imagine my reaction to your answers
10/09/25, 5:35 pm - .: unless you think I'm stupid
10/09/25, 5:35 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
10/09/25, 5:36 pm - Vega's Theorem: Idk how you expect me to answer tho, I already told you, we find ways

10/09/25, 5:36 pm - Vega's Theorem: We also got a container and sold clothes from there once, another family member paid for it
10/09/25, 5:36 pm - Vega's Theorem: My mom also resells things
10/09/25, 5:37 pm - .: is this an answer to being stupid question?
10/09/25, 5:37 pm - Vega's Theorem: Lol
10/09/25, 5:37 pm - Vega's Theorem: It was your idea to help, I didn't ask for it, if you don't want to do it is fine, just say it
10/09/25, 5:38 pm - .: I just want to know if you have just called me stupid
10/09/25, 5:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm tired of you analyzing everything to find something to be upset about
10/09/25, 5:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have not
10/09/25, 5:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: Thanks for everything you did, I won't let you do anything more then

10/09/25, 5:39 pm - .: I'm not fighting
10/09/25, 5:39 pm - .: and I'm not upset
10/09/25, 5:39 pm - Vega's Theorem: You are questioning me even tho I have already told you everything
10/09/25, 5:40 pm - Vega's Theorem: You know how that makes me feel even tho I have told you several times you don't have to do anything?
10/09/25, 5:40 pm - .: not out of doubting you
10/09/25, 5:49 pm - .: this may sound unbelievable but I was asking questions merely to have a logical understanding of the situation. You answered many times but the answers kept lacking logic to me, so I kept asking but not out of ill assumptions. I trust you.
10/09/25, 5:49 pm - .: you're very smart you can imagine how it seemed to me
10/09/25, 5:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: Of course it doesn't sound logical at all, I live in a country where 20 dollars is a lot of money, and currently the whole country is a power outage
10/09/25, 5:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: What did you expect?
10/09/25, 5:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
10/09/25, 5:50 pm - Vega's Theorem: But idk how to put it
10/09/25, 5:51 pm - .: just put it in an approximate form
10/09/25, 5:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: I already told you everything I can
10/09/25, 5:52 pm - Vega's Theorem: There is literally nothing more
10/09/25, 5:56 pm - .: I'm sorry that my questions felt invasive and suggested a lack of trust. remember that I'm autistic, and that my intentions do not often match the way I say things.

12/09/25, 4:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: And all Spanish dialects
12/09/25, 4:38 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 4:45 pm - .: so cool
12/09/25, 4:45 pm - .: tho French is a lie
12/09/25, 4:46 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's not
12/09/25, 4:46 pm - .: I looked it up
12/09/25, 4:46 pm - Vega's Theorem: We cannot understand it in the same way we can infer Portuguese
12/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: But we can absolutely understand at least some of it
12/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's very similar to Spanish
12/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: As a Spanish speaker, is very natural to me
12/09/25, 4:47 pm - Vega's Theorem: When I studied french I picked it up much faster than German
12/09/25, 4:48 pm - Vega's Theorem: And before studying I could already read some of it
12/09/25, 4:49 pm - .: yeah, it's no brainer when you think about why
12/09/25, 4:49 pm - .: shared history and geographical proximity
12/09/25, 4:49 pm - Vega's Theorem: I mean, just look at it
12/09/25, 4:50 pm - .: the pronounces of French and Spanish were suspiciously similar in school
12/09/25, 4:54 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
12/09/25, 4:56 pm - .: how are you feeling today?
12/09/25, 4:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: Stressed

12/09/25, 4:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: At least we have water
12/09/25, 4:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: Sort of
12/09/25, 4:59 pm - .: that's hard
12/09/25, 4:59 pm - .: **hugging you**
12/09/25, 5:01 pm - .: you better store water when it's available
12/09/25, 5:01 pm - Vega's Theorem: We do store it
12/09/25, 5:01 pm - .: good
12/09/25, 5:01 pm - Vega's Theorem: But it only lasts so long
12/09/25, 5:10 pm - .: if the weather is nice, I would take a walk if I were you.
12/09/25, 5:16 pm - .: you will?!
12/09/25, 5:20 pm - Vega's Theorem: No
12/09/25, 5:21 pm - .: Why say it then?
12/09/25, 5:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: To make people believe that
12/09/25, 5:52 pm - .: I usually lie about my situation when I'm asked. I find it uncomfortable to explain myself about it.
12/09/25, 5:53 pm - .: you can imagine them making judgments in their heads
12/09/25, 5:54 pm - .: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 5:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
12/09/25, 5:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: A lot of people already fell for it

12/09/25, 5:59 pm - .: ?
12/09/25, 5:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: Just fun
12/09/25, 6:00 pm - .: silly

12/09/25, 8:25 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: Ask AI if it's efficient
12/09/25, 8:26 pm - Vega's Theorem: Even tho heap based
12/09/25, 8:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm hesitant about making it stack based because controllers are dynamic in nature and their state is going to be associated with them in a heap vector anyways
12/09/25, 8:27 pm - Vega's Theorem: So either way will live in heap memory
12/09/25, 8:45 pm - .: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 8:47 pm - .: I feel weird this evening
12/09/25, 8:47 pm - .: not in a good way
12/09/25, 8:48 pm - Vega's Theorem: This feels aggressive
12/09/25, 8:49 pm - .: let's try claude for once :3
12/09/25, 8:49 pm - Vega's Theorem: Oh god can't wait for the 23th
12/09/25, 8:50 pm - .: when is the promotion?
12/09/25, 8:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: Not yet announced
12/09/25, 8:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: But will be around that date

12/09/25, 8:56 pm - Vega's Theorem: This preallocated capacity is good
12/09/25, 8:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: But honestly I will just let the runtime adjust capacity on demand
12/09/25, 8:57 pm - Vega's Theorem: I will only lose like what? A couple microseconds?
12/09/25, 8:58 pm - .: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 8:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
12/09/25, 8:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: It's not fair at all
12/09/25, 8:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: apples and oranges
12/09/25, 8:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's why I always tell you that you are not slow
12/09/25, 9:00 pm - .: I was in the top 3 in biology. so that's something
12/09/25, 9:00 pm - .: :3
12/09/25, 9:01 pm - .: it was so easy, I finish my exam early and start helping others to cheat in the middle of the exam :3
12/09/25, 9:02 pm - .: good days
12/09/25, 9:04 pm - .: tho I didn't think I was smart, I just thought the rest of the class was dumb in biology
12/09/25, 9:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: I was top 1 period
12/09/25, 9:07 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 9:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: I was praised in front of all the school multiple times for my good results in math contests
12/09/25, 9:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: And sometimes teachers would randomly say I was the brightest of the school
12/09/25, 9:08 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 9:11 pm - .: yet you don't feel smart at times
12/09/25, 9:12 pm - Vega's Theorem: I never feel smart
12/09/25, 9:12 pm - .: why?
12/09/25, 9:12 pm - .: don't you believe the evidence?
12/09/25, 9:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: Even tho I'm probably 99 percentile I always feel like the dumbest person in the room
12/09/25, 9:13 pm - Vega's Theorem: Honestly the percentile thing is scary
12/09/25, 9:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: Jsjsksk
12/09/25, 9:14 pm - .: why is that?
12/09/25, 9:14 pm - Vega's Theorem: Idk
12/09/25, 9:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm a slower thinker at times than the rest of people
12/09/25, 9:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: I cannot follow them always verbally
12/09/25, 9:15 pm - Vega's Theorem: And I'm very clumsy
12/09/25, 9:16 pm - .: I'm definitely even close to you, but the feelings are so me
12/09/25, 9:16 pm - Vega's Theorem: And I barely pay attention to what people say so it looks like I forget everything instantly
12/09/25, 9:16 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 9:17 pm - Vega's Theorem: But yeah I do not consider myself as smart
12/09/25, 9:17 pm - Vega's Theorem: I just happen to learn fast
12/09/25, 9:18 pm - .: I read that smart people analyse things in more complex ways which makes them perform slower
12/09/25, 9:18 pm - .: you may be a 2e person
12/09/25, 9:19 pm - .: it's common in neurodivergents
12/09/25, 9:19 pm - Vega's Theorem: I have also noticed that I go deeper than the others, like

"Wait, this is actually more nuanced than it seems, let's go slower for a second"
12/09/25, 9:19 pm - .: YES!!!
12/09/25, 9:19 pm - .: there is always more to it that it seems
12/09/25, 9:20 pm - .: poeple seems to just gloss the surface and think they've got clarity
12/09/25, 9:21 pm - Vega's Theorem: But yeah I really do not score as high as expected in IQ testing
12/09/25, 9:21 pm - Vega's Theorem: Most of my friends say I probably score between 140 and 150 when in reality is 130 to 140
12/09/25, 9:21 pm - .: you said you scored in the 99 percentile
12/09/25, 9:21 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's just an educated guess
12/09/25, 9:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Is actually 98
12/09/25, 9:22 pm - .: that's in the 2 top percentile
12/09/25, 9:22 pm - .: yeah
12/09/25, 9:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: Is really, really weird
12/09/25, 9:22 pm - Vega's Theorem: As in, in practice even 98 feels low
12/09/25, 9:23 pm - Vega's Theorem: I'm in pair with most of my 140-150 friends in practice
12/09/25, 9:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: As in, our overlapping skills in those fields
12/09/25, 9:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: So idk
12/09/25, 9:24 pm - Vega's Theorem: Maybe that's just for math?
12/09/25, 9:28 pm - .: yeah, that's possible. I mean the polzaro sisters were exceptional just at chess, which they started at 4yo.
12/09/25, 9:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: True
12/09/25, 9:29 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
12/09/25, 9:29 pm - .: the brain is quit plastic at a young age and naturaly optimises for efficiency for doing a reapeated thing.
12/09/25, 9:29 pm - .: for you is math
12/09/25, 9:30 pm - .: you're brain is better at learning math and learning in general I think
12/09/25, 9:30 pm - .: even if your general IQ is lower than those freinds
12/09/25, 9:31 pm - .: I've read shit load about the brain
12/09/25, 9:32 pm - .: lol
12/09/25, 9:32 pm - .: it was a special interest
12/09/25, 9:33 pm - .: I'm actually a left handed by birth, but was forced to use my right hand. if I try to go back to my natural hand it will lower my intelligence
12/09/25, 9:36 pm - .: the brain has built efficiency not just for coordination for my hand, but it is deeply intertwined with other functions in the brain. disturbing it is disturbing overall efficiency in brain networks
12/09/25, 9:37 pm - .: may not have said that in a clear way
12/09/25, 9:37 pm - .: anyway I'm just info dumping

13/09/25, 11:50 pm - .: isnt it 3k?
13/09/25, 11:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: Is it?
13/09/25, 11:51 pm - .: <Media omitted>
13/09/25, 11:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: Oh that's great
13/09/25, 11:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: <Media omitted>
13/09/25, 11:51 pm - Vega's Theorem: I can sell those for 12k

13/09/25, 11:53 pm - Vega's Theorem: something?!
13/09/25, 11:53 pm - .: it's not much when you use it in the privat market
13/09/25, 11:53 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's A LOT
13/09/25, 11:54 pm - Vega's Theorem: No no, trust me, I can use it
13/09/25, 11:54 pm - Vega's Theorem: I will try to sell at 10k
13/09/25, 11:54 pm - .: there is the veggies market where the prices are different than the private market right?
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: Yeah
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: No really
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: In my own experience I have not found any private person or company that sells vegetables
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: And the official means are expensive asf and not a lot of variety
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: But I mean
13/09/25, 11:55 pm - Vega's Theorem: With 9k I can buy a lot anyway
13/09/25, 11:56 pm - .: you should buy lots of beans, root vegetables
13/09/25, 11:56 pm - .: they're good value for the money
13/09/25, 11:56 pm - Vega's Theorem: The only thing I don't eat are beans
13/09/25, 11:56 pm - .: you have to such it up Vega

13/09/25, 11:57 pm - .: but sure
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: I like only dry food :3
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: That's why
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: And you cannot really do dry beans
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: You technically could but
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - Vega's Theorem: Why
13/09/25, 11:58 pm - .: okay, you don't have to explain.
13/09/25, 11:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: _dry enough_
13/09/25, 11:59 pm - Vega's Theorem: I won't buy anything expensive so it lasts longer
